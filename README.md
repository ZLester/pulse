## Description

ProjectMonitor is a CI aggregator to help teams monitor the status of their builds.
The project consists of 3 primary components:
* Pulse CI Build API [postman](ci.pivotallabs.com)
* Pulse Management Tool
* Pulse Monitor Display [demo](ci.pivotallabs.com)

![](https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/images/labs/tools/project_monitor.png)

The intent of pulse is to display the status of multiple Continuous Integration builds on a single web page.
Displaying the status of all your projects' builds on a big screen monitor or TV provides a highly visible/glanceable resource
for the development team to triage any issues!

Pulse currently supports:
* :(

Roadmap for integration:
* CircleCI
* Codeship
* Concourse
* Cruise Control
* Jenkins
* Semaphore
* Solano CI (formerly loved as tddium)
* TeamCity
* Travis CI
* Travis CI Pro

We use Pulse internally at Pivotal Labs to display the status of the builds for all our client projects.
We also have an instance of Pulse running at [ci.pivotallabs.com](ci.pivotallabs.com) that we use for displaying the status of the builds
of various open source projects - both of projects Pivotal Labs maintains (such as Jasmine)
and of non-Pivotal projects (such as Rails).

Pulse is using Pivotal Tracker to manage development of the project.  Ideas for new features are stored in the icebox.
