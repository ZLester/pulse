# Contributing

Because contributing to Pulse is nobody's full-time job, pull requests are a vital part of our workflow. We really value contributions both from within the Pivotal Labs community as well as outside contributors. There are a few guidelines that we think will help make your pull request (and ultimately, Pulse itself) successful:

1. Review the [vision](https://github.com/pivotal/pulse/wiki/Vision) for Pulse. This outlines our long-term goals.
2. Take a look at our existing [backlog](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/1456574), which should give you an idea of where we're headed. If you can take stories off our backlog, so much the better! In this case, please [include the commit ID](https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/level-up-your-development-workflow-with-github-pivotal-tracker) in brackets somewhere in the commit message, so that we can link commits to stories and vice versa. ([Here's an example](https://github.com/pivotal/pulse/commit/8455c9a99eaed82679b4ca9ae7380bae12278967).)
3. Pulse is an example of [README-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) with respect to configuration and development: if your pull request includes changes to the way the app is run, installed, set up or executed, please include changes to the README so that the next person who comes along doesn't have to look at the code to get started. If your change is specific to either the frontend or the backend, you can place your change in the corresponding README instead of the top-level directory.
4. Before making your change, please [file an issue](https://github.com/pivotal/pulse/issues) in GitHub just to give us a heads up that you're working on something. This gives us a chance to let you know if we already have code in motion or if we're not interested in pursuing that direction before you write a ton of code. If you're interested in being a regular contributor, let us know and we can add you to the Pivotal Tracker instance.
5. Please include complete and passing tests with your code.

Thanks so much for contributing!
